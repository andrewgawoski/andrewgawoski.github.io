The story begins in media res, and in order to reach that point, Percy and Bors had to overcome several dangerous, difficult, and frightening obstacles already such as traversing terrain filled with deadly creatures in the outside jungle, having narrowly escaped a plane crash with their lives, and crossing a river-bottomed ravine lined with sharp, pointy rocks and sticks. Also, there were probably snakes and piranhas and stuff too. It was scary. Trust us we’re profession dungeon delvers.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">A B1 room is a kind of room.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of a B1 room is usually &quot;<span class="quote">B1</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">A B2 room is a kind of room.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of a B2 room is usually &quot;<span class="quote">B2</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Doorway initialization]</span></p><p class="indent0">A brass-inlaid door is a kind of thing.
