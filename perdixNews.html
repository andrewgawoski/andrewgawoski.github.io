							<h4 align="left" style = "text-indent: 15px"><i>Friday, January 13th, 2017</i></h4>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Development on Perdix is slowing down. There are a number of factors, but perhaps most importantly I think I'll be helping out a friend with a project of their's in the near future. I'll still work on Perdix in my free time, and recently I've been doing some UI work for the game. Its difficult to find best practices for everything, given that so many solutions in games will be unique to the game itself.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">So yeah, recently working on UI. The game over screen is finally complete from a technical side. It'd be nice to have some more graphical elements to it, but the elements fade in nicely and the player is presented with appropriate options that work as expected. I have heard from quite a few folks that not many people like working on UI, and sure, I can see why. It isn't exactly in the forefront of peoples' minds as they play a game, unless its poorly done. Bad UI sticks out. Even so, while it might not be as glamorous as working on other portions of the game, having good, responsive, unobtrusive, and intuitive UI goes a long way towards a good player experience. At least in my case, that's something I think you should be proud of if you do well, there's always satisfaction in creating something that seems to work perfectly. Strive for greatness in everything you make, even if you're making UI. Especially if you're making UI.</p>

							<h4 align="left" style = "text-indent: 15px"><i>Sunday, January 1st, 2017</i></h4>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">A new post for a new year. I'll just go over briefly what I've <i>finished</i>, started working on and still needs to be done for Perdix. The assets, sound, sprites, and other textures are do not exist in a game-completed state. The game currently has no sound, no <i>actual</i> animations for characters, and only a small handful of textures and sprites that look nice enough, but may be replaced. Work has primarily been done on the second level planned for the game, which contains the kind of environment seen in the preview from my last post of 2016 (without the snow).</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">This means that every single level, Act I through Act IX planned, need to be completed and all but one of them need to be started. And of course this will need all sorts of new assets, probably some additional code adjustments for particle systems. Nevermind that I was working on a save system until I realized that I needed more information on how levels were going to work to figure out what needed to be saved. So that still needs to be completed as well. As far as other stuff goes from title-screen access goes, I also need to make the options menu, and hopefully allow for keybinding. I know Unity has some odd thing where you can select keybinds prior to game launch, but it looks so much more professional to change them in game.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Truthfully, even the player controller is only 70% or so completed. I was originally going to say 90%, and then 80% but realized that not only did I have to write in some sun-mechanics, I also needed kitesail deployment in the controller, in addition to actually being able to attack. Speaking of attacks, enemies currently do not exist. While they might not exist on the second level for the most part, they definitely need to be completed eventually. Pathfinding seems like it would be a chore for most of the second level given how dynamic it is, and while I love decision trees and general AI implementation, I don't have very much experience with platforming pathfinding. I know that writing AI for mario-like titles is fairly popular, but in academia, I've mostly worked on top down/graph traversal algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's. I think it'll be a bit different to have AI jump from platforms, especially if I want to make them smart to wind-effects.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">That wind system is implemented though, and has generic interactions! The foundations of lives, checkpoints and game over states are in the game. The game over screen itself needs some more player input added (so you can actually get past the screen). The player controller for movement and wind control is almost there, I'd consider it done for the most part. Additionally, there are generic C# scripts for periodic motion, and manipulation of particle systems by the wind, easily tuned per object in the inspector. The simple shader I wrote before has some decidely complex applications, and I'm incredibly glad to have written it by now. The title screen itself could be considered to be in a release-like state. It can be improved, but later.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">All said, as a programmer I'm focusing more on the code-side of progress for Perdix, and I feel like on that end I didn't accomplish as much I would have liked to by this point. But, I also realize that as a single developer, there's a good deal more that I needed to do than write code, and I probably accomplished more than I think. Happy new year, folks.</p>

							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Last post for 2016! Didn't accomplish a whole lot the past week, and spent time with friends and family that were in town. There is a definite feeling of lost momentum towards Perdix that needs to be picked back up again. I did manage a video showing off the shader mentioned last week on some moving water, though.</p>
							<br>
							<p align="center"><video width = "608" height="320" controls><source src="images/newPreview.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support this video.</video></p>
							<br>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">It is a shame though that the shader looks a lot better at higher resolution in the game itself. Not a whole lot I can do about that at the moment and something strange seems to happen if the video loops. Its actually the first few frames of the video. Odd. Anyway, folks will just have to play the game when its ready. I'm not about to make promises, but it'd be nice to have the game in an early playtesting state in the next few months.</p>

							<h4 align="left" style = "text-indent: 15px"><i>Thursday, December 22nd, 2016</i></h4>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">While I haven't been keeping my development schedule tied to dedicated sprints, I'm going to try to write something here about once a week. It isn't so much that I think many folks will end up visiting this page in particular, but that I might be able to archive these posts when I move the devblog to a more fitting platform (eventually). Its been a long week and half now working with Unity's Shaderlab and Nvidia's CG. It has been challenging.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Earlier today, however, I made a huge breakthrough and wrote a shader that appears to work "<i>perfectly</i>." This was in large part due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJxxXjoZE30&index=1&list=PLV4HCa5XqFT02gZOZ_Jb_A66wqDhZMCkN">a detailed shader tutorial series</a> on Youtube by Unitycookie (now CG Cookie). I thought it was a little on the lengthy-side, and the earlier parts are definitely geared towards less experienced programmers, but it covered a lot of structure which I couldn't find solid documentation on. In hindsight again, I might have had better luck looking through Nvidia's CG documentation compared to documentation specific to Unity. My issue was declaring certain functions as the vertex and fragment functions ahead of time. Once I realized that those functions were being run <i>automatically</i>, and to an extent how they were being run, I dropped the series to try writing the shader again. I found success almost immediately.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">A shader (for sprites currently) for "Unmoving Plaid." That particular effect hasn't been used that frequently in games, particularly modern titles, with the most notable example of it being Stan's shirt in the Monkey Island series of games. I'm still not proficient enough at writing shaders to claim that it will work on all platforms, or that its particularly efficient. However, it should be easy to adjust the shader to work with 3D game objects as well. The only snag is that the effect requires a second texture as large as the entire screen, or some other form of trickery. Early testing has created some important design questions because the effect is currently incredibly striking and vibrant. Coincidentally, a recently released indie title called Botolo uses the effect. I can't speak for exactly how the effect is implemented in Botolo, but I'm happy that other folks appreciate this sort of aesthetic choice as well.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">This was one of the last major core-design items I'd need completed before I show anything about Perdix off. I wanted a beautiful, surprising visual effect that my friends, family and colleagues would remember. Hopefully I'll be sharing how the game looks soon enough.</p>

							<h4 align="left" style = "text-indent: 15px"><i>Saturday, December 13th, 2016</i></h4>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Last post I talked a little about search indexing. Today, I'm hoping I might drive a little more traffic here while helping some other developers out. The other day, I was working with code using Unity's particle systems (Shuriken in Unity 5.3.5), and wanted to manipulate specific properties of the system during runtime with code. In particular, Perdix has an involved wind system/mechanics which I would like to affect various two-dimensional particle effects such as leaves, snow, and ash. I won't go into the specifics of setting up the system itself to use 2D assets for a 2D game, as that question is answered in a number of other places and isn't very difficult to solve with the provided documentation. In my case, I wanted to modify the "Velocity over lifetime" module of the particle system. I'm also using C# for this.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">So, I had created a new C# script with a class inheriting from monobehavior to be attached to the particle system game object in the scene. In this class, I'd created a private ParticleSystem datamember, which I set to a reference of the object's ParticleSystem component using the GameObject GetComponent method within the class's start method. Now that I have my particle system reference, inside the update method I created a new datamember set to that particle system's velocityOverLifetime property. I made sure that the new datamember was enabled before modifying it, which would then modify the existing particle system. I set the datamember's x and y components individually to new ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve(), which has a number of different arguments that can be passed. In addition to using an actively updating Vector2 from elsewhere in my game (a WindController class) to represent the wind speed, which I multiply by an arbitrary coefficient before using it as an argument for the MinMaxCurve constructor, I also have a small displacement float variable. I have the value based on the wind Vector2 in both of the arguments for my MinMaxCurve constructor, but I subtract that displacement from the first and add it to the second to create small amounts of randomness in the falling snow particles I've created. It drifts left and right, as I've done this for the x component of particle velocity, and its really a nice effect. </p>

							<h4 align="left" style = "text-indent: 15px"><i>Saturday, December 10th, 2016</i></h4>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">What's in a name? That which we call <i>Perdix</i> by any other name would play the same. Originally this project was named Gnomon, back when it was conceptualized in late 2014. At the time, there was significantly less focus on action or platforming. Instead, as the namesake being part of a sundial suggests, the Gnomon of 2014 focused on the revealing nature of light through the creation of shadows. With plans for a striking aesthetic to accentuate and strengthen the effects of light in the game, this project was very different two years ago. I'm not sure if the light-revealing mechanic is something that will make it into Perdix. I'm not sure if I would consider them the same game anymore. Even so, a number of features have remained like the player character carrying the sun and to an extent the choice of art style as well. But, if the sun is still in the game, what was wrong with "Gnomon?"</p>
							
							<p align="center"><b>Search indexing.</b></p>
							
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Gnomon by itself isn't a particularly common phrase, so I was hoping that my project would be the only thing to turn up when searching for combinations of "Gnomon" and "Game." However, unbeknownst to me there was an art-trade-school in Los Angeles which focuses on film and games sharing that name. It wouldn't work. I'd be putting myself and my work at a disadvantage if I chose to compete. Otherwise, I'd definitely be using that name. Logos, titles and various other design work has been done with that name. I still might end up using it.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">I don't really care for the name "Perdix." It is both latin for "partridge" and the name of Daedalus's nephew in Greek mythology. Its an ironic choice given the partridge's relative avoidance of flight that I would choose the name because of its connection to flight through Icarus through Daedalus. Its a challenge to get a well-fitting one-word name for a game that isn't in use. I guess its very similar to username availability where tons of users end up with strings of numbers at the end of their names and the owner of the original name isn't even active. I think its even worse for names based in Greek mythology. Folks will just use any old existing Greek name for games with a science fiction setting.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">It still comes back to search indexing. I can't make claims of absolute truth, but the following are my observations and opinions. A well-created, polished, fun and popular game will have better search indexing (obvious). Popularity of a game likely has a positive correlation with money spent on marketing, which similarly has a positive correlation with studio size. In this way, I'd argue that search indexing issues can be solved with enough money (also fairly obvious). Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a relationship between number of words in a title and its memorability. But as you approach either extreme in title length, you become more prententious. In general, longer titles lead to better search indexing because of how specific they are. Creating new words will also lead to better indexing, unless in some cases that new word is a common misspelling of an existing word. I think I need a longer title and I hope I get there eventually. Until then, I'm happy to call this project a partridge, even if I don't want to call the game itself Perdix.</p>
