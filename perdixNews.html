							<p style="text-indent: 30px">What's in a name? That which we call <i>Perdix</i> by any other name would play the same. Originally this project was named Gnomon, back when it was conceptualized in late 2014. At the time, there was significantly less focus on action or platforming. Instead, as the namesake being part of a sundial suggests, the Gnomon of 2014 focused on the revealing nature of light through the creation of shadows. With plans for a striking aesthetic to accentuate and strengthen the effects of light in the game, this project was very different two years ago. I'm not sure if the light-revealing mechanic is something that will make it into Perdix. I'm not sure if I would consider them the same game anymore. Even so, a number of features have remained like the player character carrying the sun and to an extent the choice of art style as well. But, if the sun is still in the game, what was wrong with "Gnomon?"</p>
							
							<p align="center"><b>Search indexing.</b></p>
							
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">Gnomon by itself isn't a particularly common phrase, so I was hoping that my project would be the only thing to turn up when searching for combinations of "Gnomon" and "Game." However, unbeknownst to me there was an art-trade-school in Los Angeles which focuses on film and games sharing that name. It wouldn't work. I'd be putting myself and my work at a disadvantage if I chose to compete. Otherwise, I'd definitely be using that name. Logos, titles and various other design work has been done with that name. I still might end up using it.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">I don't really care for the name "Perdix." It is both latin for "partridge" and the name of Daedalus's nephew in Greek mythology. Its an ironic choice given the partridge's relative avoidance of flight that I would choose the name because of its connection to flight through Icarus through Daedalus. Its a challenge to get a well-fitting one-word name for a game that isn't in use. I guess its very similar to username availability where tons of users end up with strings of numbers at the end of their names and the owner of the original name isn't even active. I think its even worse for names based in Greek mythology. Folks will just use any old existing Greek name for games with a science fiction setting.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px">It still comes back to search indexing. I can't make claims of absolute truth, but the following are my observations and opinions. A well-created, polished, fun and popular game will have better search indexing (obvious). Popularity of a game likely has a positive correlation with money spent on marketing, which similarly has a positive correlation with studio size. In this way, I'd argue that search indexing issues can be solved with enough money (also fairly obvious). Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a relationship between number of words in a title and its memorability. But as you approach either extreme in title length, you become more prententious. In general, longer titles lead to better search indexing because of how specific they are. Creating new words will also lead to better indexing, unless in some cases that new word is a common misspelling of an existing word. I think I need a longer title and I hope I get there eventually. Until then, I'm happy to call this project a partridge, even if I don't want to call the game itself Perdix.</p>
