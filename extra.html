						<p style="text-indent: 30px">I often find myself overthinking things; solutions are rarely as difficult as I initially think, and much more often incredibly simple. I hold very strong opinions about tea, and don't care much for coffee. I've watched a lot of cooking videos online, but I'm not sure if I like cooking or just like delicious-looking food.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">I feel pretty capable of accomplishing anything I set my mind to eventually. I'm proud of my handwriting, both its appearance and readability. I'm a former boyscout. I know how to fish. I can drive a manual transmission. I can read music. I like learning foreign languages when I have the time, having mild experience with Spanish, Japanese and want to learn Irish Gaelic.</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">Deck-building tabletop games like Dominion are a lot of fun for me and I also infrequently play Magic the Gathering. I usually prefer Magic's limited formats like draft and sealed where one of the goals is to create a deck with unpredictably limited resources.</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">I'm really excited for Perdix because I'm applying some of the material I learned at University that wasn't directly related to programming to create a deeper experience for players. It feels a little pretentious to make discrete references to mythology that isn't that well known outside of South and Central America, but I think it suits the game and its mechanics very well.</p>

						<p><b>Questions I Want to Answer:</b></p>
						<p><i>What's your favorite kind of tea?</i></p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">For black teas, I really like Earl Grey with a little bit of honey. Although my favorite is probably the free tea from a local Chinese restaurant before it closed.</p>
						<p><i>You mentioned you were a Boy Scout at one point, were you an Eagle Scout?</i></p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">I never became an Eagle Scout. My troop fell apart before that really happened. I've met several Eagle Scouts from different troops afterwards though and even helped out with a project or two.</p>
						<p><i>What was your exposure to programming and games before you started learning C++ in 2010?</i></p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">I learned and assisted in teaching html in middle school. In highschool I probably made over a dozen games with Game Maker including a Guitar Hero clone for an ROP class. In my senior year of highschool, I eventually worked with Arduino microcontrollers and developed simple robot AI, probably in C++.</p>
						<p><i>This is an awfully plain-looking portfolio.</i></p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">Yes, it is. Isn't it great?</p>
