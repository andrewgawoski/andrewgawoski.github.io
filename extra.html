						<p style="text-indent: 30px">A lot of the time I’ll think too much about something and sometimes I’ll wind up too indecisive to move forward with something. I eventually noticed how similar baseball pitching motions and tennis serving were and felt inspired to take a little baseball into my tennis serve. My serve might be worse off than when I first started playing. I really like watching instructional cooking videos, especially for food from different cultures that I might not have seen before. I want to say that it makes me better at cooking, but I might just watch them because delicious food is amazing. I think I might be mildly allergic to honeydew melon but will sometimes eat it anyway without major consequence. I think tea is better than coffee. I might try to grow my own tea someday. I prefer to put between 1-2 teaspoons of honey instead of sugar into a cup of tea but will also drink it unsweetened. I will quietly judge anyone who adds anything to white, green or oolong teas but I’m probably also happy that someone else is drinking tea.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Most of the time I both feel it’s impossible to live up to my own expectations of myself and also feel capable of eventually accomplishing anything I set my mind to. I’m proud of my handwriting. I’m a former Boy Scout. While currently unlicensed, I know how to fish. I can drive manual. I can understand small amounts of Spanish and Japanese, but would like to learn Irish Gaelic in the future. I value the education I received at UCSC but sometimes some aspects of the university felt like an echo chamber. I can read music and at one point could play piano but am out of practice.</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">I enjoy deck-building tabletop games such as dominion a lot, and also really like playing Magic the Gathering every now and then. Limited format play such as draft and sealed are great and I probably have more fun attempting to construct the best deck I can with my resources than competing with other players. I’ll watch anime occasionally, particularly with friends, but don’t watch it or TV in general very often at all. If I had to credit something with getting me into programming and game design to begin with, I’d probably say some combination of the Megaman Battle Network series and original .hack series were important because of their inclusion of code and AI elements. My first experience with 3D games was playing Ocarina of Time from a hospital bed when I was little. It was an excellent distraction and I understand the importance of the medium as a method of escape. Coincidentally, I have a fear of needles and objects visible underneath the skin but no issues with blood.</p>

						<p style="text-indent: 30px">Perdix, previously called Gnomon, which you might have seen mentioned elsewhere in this portfolio has become a project I'm pretty passionate about. I'm currently trying to figure how I'm going to get/create the assets for it given its planned art direction. Keeping a journal of design ideas, I can safely say that Perdix has cannibalized a mechanic from another idea and I think has come out much stronger for it.</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 30px">The fictional setting of the game isn't anywhere in particular, but is loosely influenced by Greco-Roman mythology. I want to justify this by its relative cultural familiarity in western civilization, but the story and setting are loosely tied to the monomyth and also contain influences of native Central and South American mythology. I'm not an expert in either of these fields, and want to be respectful of other cultures. I'm planning to avoid making overt references, leaving some interpretation to the player while adding small elements of different cultural mythology that they might find familiar. Much like how adding spices like nutmeg to Béchamel sauce doesn't seem like it contributes very much, I hope that allowing these cultures to influence Perdix adds an elusive complexity of flavor or additional depth to the game that players might come to appreciate.</p>
