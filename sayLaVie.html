				<p style="text-indent: 30px">A lot was successfully accomplished in this senior capstone project, not to say it didn’t have issues. Our team had a fantastically detailed design document, and in general the early design work went very well. All of this done within a span of four actual months of development, we implemented a simple, rural French town with a small population of townsfolk the player could interact with in a few different ways. We tackled problems such as the apparent lack of support for special characters within Unreal Engine 4’s FString class, resulting in our use of an in-house customized font to allow for proper French letter accents. We eventually got voice acting, including voicing from native French speakers into the game. The two-dimensional art assets and music were also fantastic.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px">The worst of the game probably came about through the production side of things. Some issues were controllable, and others significantly less so. With a series of different, often extensive personal emergencies disrupting the work and schedule of different team members throughout development time, our team was not creating code and content to our capabilities. With a seven-person team, not including artists, we probably should have been able to deliver a better game experience despite that. However, for the scope of the title, I personally think seven might have been excessive and may have contributed to some inefficient task-allocation. Some of the tasks we had discussed during our frequent Scrum meetings ended up taking a lot longer than they should have, or otherwise seemingly ignored for even months.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px">Additionally, while our 2D assets were excellent, our 3D assets making up the majority of what the player sees during gameplay left a lot to be desired. For the amount of content we required for Say La Vie, our team had to compete amongst somewhere around a dozen teams for the same tiny pool of university artists, many of whom did not have any experience making digital content, least of all 3D content. Games may not need to look good to be good, but outward appearances definitely help. As I was responsible for coordinating the efforts of our small art team among other responsibilities, I often felt relatively helpless with regards to what limited resources we had available. At one point, I took on the creation of a number of necessary assets, and I know other team members did as well. As every team member from our capstone class was required to be a proficient programmer, time spent creating models was time not spent writing code.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px">Workflow and version control issues also plagued the project, particularly early on in development. At the time of development, Unreal 4 was heavily pushed by school faculty and instructors. Our team had difficulty using Git for an Unreal 4 project, seemingly due to size constraints. With the countless models in the game being updated and replaced, the binary assets for our project required an unexpected amount of space. We switched over to the more Unreal 4 friendly, but less familiar subversion for source control. Afterwards we ran into size limitations set by the repository hosts we tried, leading us to switch hosting for the repo a few times. This kind of problem may not have affected longer projects as significantly as ours, given that it hopefully occurs early on in development, but it created a period of time where there was more difficulty collaborating on the project. Version control should probably be given a very high priority to sort out when required; decide early and get it working quickly.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px">Our game enjoyed solid success on social media relative to most other projects produced in our year, but I’m unsure how much of that was due to the merits of Say La Vie and not the people working on it. I feel as though keeping up appearances caused difficulties for production as well. Small teams may not have a choice but to handle their own public relations, but it does take away from development time. Our public relations work involved required preparation for an end of year department award show, providing for additional deadlines, and opportunities for communication over non-development-related work to break down. Crunch time at its finest.</p>
