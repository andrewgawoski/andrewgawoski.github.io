                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>Summoner Timers is an assistant application for players of Riot Games’ League of Legends. The application allows players to keep track of the cooldown for various different in game abilities not displayed by the game’s UI. Users may select from automatic and manual ability entry.</p>
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pulls information to create timers from live games</li>
                    <li>Accurately maintains timers for 10 unique abilities at once</li>
                    <li>Apply modifiers to timers consistent with League of Legends’ game logic</li>
                    <li>Support through League of Legends patch 6.8</li>

				<p style="text-indent: 30px">Summoner Timers was created alone around the point of my graduation, and was developed in Java with the Android Studio IDE and built with Gradle. While the application does seek to fill a need in keeping track of information that Riot Games' popular title League of Legends does not, this was designed explicitly to take advantage of a 3rd-party API. It was fully capable of manual offline-entry usage as well as the online using retrofit and json libraries. All things considered, I'm mostly pleased with how everything turned out.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px">One of the elements of development I could have improved resulted from poor planning. I don't feel that the json received from API queries works particularly well with java compared to a web-based application. This has more to do with the structure itself, with a class sharing a player's name rather than having a generic player class with a name field. There's likely a good reason for it, but it was inconvenient at first when trying to use retrofit to fill in existing class structures. Eventually the response from querying the API was parsed as a string and then modified to map directly to the generic classes I had created.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px">Additionally, I wish I had started development with the online functionality. Developing for offline usage first, I created my own classes and objects to handle player and game information in order to automatically populate the application's timers. In a number of cases, the API response did not map directly to what I had already created and needed additional translation. It was entirely possible to receive champion objects including name, icon, and other information I used directly from the API without the need for me to manually include those resources. On the other hand, including everything as I did allowed the application to run completely offline. I prefer my own object organization as expected, but following objects returned by an API would make it cleaner.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px">The other issues faced resulted from cutting user information saving as a feature and a single API query instance. User information saving was implemented but did not work as expected. As the feature was added late in development and did not interfere with the normal usage of the application, it remained in as is. Being able to save user preferences would have been a huge quality of life improvement that I feel I would have needed prior to release. With regards to the API query, one call was switched off of retrofit to a significantly sloppier method of my own design. Eventually it worked, but its success seems dependent on connection speed and android device hardware. As terrible as that sounds, the string parsing solution was implemented after this and I do believe reverting this call to use retrofit again would be both trivial and solve the inconsistent behavior.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px">I found development was a valuable experience with native android programming and use of a well-known game studio's API. For a number of reasons, not the least of which is the lacking discussion surrounding java and android use of Riot Games' API, the source code for this application will be made publicly available for the benefit of other developers who may desire to create something similar.</p>
